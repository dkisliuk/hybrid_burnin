ReadTests is a ROOT macro for launching ITSDAQ and running tests. 
It runs as a server (launched automatically by Master) and runs the tests requested by the HybridGUI.
It can launch the ITSDAQ Stavelet GUI, read HCC and ChipID, run Strobe Delay, Trim Range, Three Point Gain, Response Curve, and Noise Occupancy tests. When a test is complete, it sends an 'ACK' message back to the client.
